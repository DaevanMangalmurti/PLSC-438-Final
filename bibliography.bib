	abstract = {This paper aims to measure the impact of HSR on urban land growth and to explore how the impact varies between different types of cites. Since HSR route planning decisions are influenced by the economic status of cities en route, whether a city gets an HSR station is likely to be endogenous to its economic growth and land development rate. To address this endogeneity, we adopt a Two-period Panel Data Instrumental Variable model using post road network in the Ming Dynasty and locations of military bases as instrumental variables. Results show that being connected to the HSR network on average leads to a 11.2\% faster rate of growth of urban built-up areas. More interestingly, we document substantial heterogeneity in this impact based on the size and location of cities. Causes and mechanism for such heterogeneity are also elaborated, together with the policy and planning implications.},

	abstract = {China has launched an ambitious strategy to develop a national high-speed rail (HSR) system with a total distance of 38,000 km by 2025. The massive development of HSR has not only facilitated the improvement of interregional accessibility, it also substantially stimulated urbanization and urban expansions across various cities. This paper investigates fundamental questions pertaining to change in land use related to HSR in China. First, does the development of HSR play a role in promoting change in urban land use structure? Second, does land use structure change have a spatial dimension related to HSR development? For the first time, the spatial dimension of urban land use as it is related to HSR development is evaluated empirically using a spatial panel regression analysis. The assessment is based on a micro-level land use data covering 285 cities for the period 2007−2015. The research findings reveal that HSR plays a significant role in promoting urban land use structure change in China. The influence of HSR is much larger than that from other types of transportation infrastructure. In addition, impacts were found to vary across different size scales of cities. In particular, the impact of HSR on change in urban land use structure was found significant in Tier 2–3 cities. Conversely, the financial constraint of local government was also confirmed to have a significant influence on land use structure change in medium and small cities (Tier 3–5 cities). Overall, the study provides evidence and implications for policy makers to improve decision-makings on land use policy reforms and guidance for future infrastructure development.},

	abstract = {Local government debt has grown rapidly in China, threatening financial stability and economic growth and raising concerns globally. Although previous literature has examined various determinants of local government debt cost, little attention has been paid to the potential effect of transportation infrastructure on it. Utilizing data of Chinese municipal corporate bonds from 2008 to 2019, we examine the effect of high-speed rail (HSR) on the financing costs of local government in peripheral cities. We find that HSR access leads to higher issuance credit spread of municipal corporate bonds, suggesting that opening HSR increases rather than decreases local government financial costs. This result is robust after addressing potential endogeneity issues. Moreover, our mechanism analysis shows that the “implicit guarantee mechanism” accounts for this effect. Overall, this paper highlights the essential role of transportation infrastructure in determining local government financing costs.},

This article aims to understand the booming development of HSR new towns in China through the theoretical lens of state entrepreneurialism. It dissects the entrepreneurial behaviors of the local state in a medium-sized city, which harnesses the HSR project strategically to develop a new town. Our findings reveal that local governments play out state entrepreneurialism in developing HSR new towns. They compete with other cities for HSR projects. They are motivated by land revenue generation, career advancement for officials, and maintaining state power. Furthermore, this article contributes to the understanding of interactions among multi-level governments. Local states in China can also exert influence on the policymaking and resource allocation of the national government.},

This study employs an improved spatial econometric model to examine the motivation of local officials behind the construction of HSR stations. We employ a comprehensive dataset consisting of information about HSR station construction, the promotion of officials, the economic growth rate, etc., in 246 prefecture-level cities in China. The findings suggest that local officials are not making their decisions regarding HSR stations solely on conditions in their own cities. The construction of HSR stations is largely affected by the peer effect arising from geographic adjacency, economic adjacency and administrative adjacency. This is mainly because China’s local officials are engaged in the Promotion Tournament based on Yardstick Competition. Political promotion strengthens the peer effect. In addition, the fact that no directional learning between developed and underdeveloped cities reveals the severity of the peer effect in the construction of HSR stations. This paper has also offered several policy implications based on empirical analysis.},

By analysing field interview data and secondary information, the research addresses a key question about whether multi-tier governments play a concerted role in station area planning and development decision-making. The findings reveal that the siting of the station, the planning of the station area, and the development of the different sectors of the HSR station and its vicinity are outcomes of the interplay between the central and the local governments, each of which has their distinctive logic in discharging responsibilities and pursuing interests associated with the projects. In the siting of the Wuhan HSR station, the municipal and central governments interacted actively with each other to safeguard their visions of development, whilst in the planning and development of the station vicinity, both the municipal and the central administrations were passive to collaboration thus foregone an opportunity to develop an integrated HSR station project.},

With a difference-in-differences design applied to Chinese prefecture-level cities, I find that politically connected cities were more likely to win their superior’s support to obtain the projects approved by the four-trillion-Yuan stimulus enacted in 2008 and increased the city’s public investment in infrastructure. Meanwhile, these politically connected cities accumulated more public debts than other unconnected cities. Furthermore, those cities that lacked such political connections were more likely to promote private investment by introducing business-friendly policies. These results show that patron-client connections make an economic development model that features government investment and public debts more possible than the one that depends on vibrant entrepreneurship and private investment.},

Our findings indicate that a surviving revolutionary makes his birth county 41.1\% more likely to receive the central government’s approval for railway investment. After ruling out a series of alternative explanations, we show that the retired revolutionaries’ influence stems primarily from their instrumental roles in the founding of the regime, which boosts local requests for investment in the eyes of central policymakers. Our findings highlight a bottom-up intergovernmental dynamic that translates personal influence into policy benefits.},

This dualist strategy allows the ruling elites to achieve economic performance while minimizing the advancement of potentially disloyal challengers. Thus, balancing between loyalty and competence among subordinates enhances regime survival. Our empirical evidence draws on a comprehensive panel dataset of provincial, prefectural, and county-level Communist party secretaries and government executives appointed between 1999 and 2007. We find consistent evidence for our argument under various model specifications. We also explore the heterogeneous effects of performance on promotion given the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) age ineligibility rule for cadre promotion and jurisdiction characteristics.},

As of December 2022, it extends to 31 of the country's 33 provincial-level administrative divisions and exceeds 40,000 km (25,000 mi) in total length, accounting for about two-thirds of the world's high-speed rail tracks in commercial service. Over the past decade, China’s high-speed rail network grew rapidly according to ambitious railway plans issued by the State. The "Mid- to Long-Term Railway Network Plan" ("Railway Network Plan") approved by the State Council in 2004 called for 12,000 km (7,456 mi) of passenger-dedicated HSR lines running train at speeds of at least 200 km/h (124 mph) by 2020. The 2008 Revisions to the Railway Network Plan increased the year 2020 passenger-dedicated HSR network target length to 16,000 km (9,942 mi) and removed the 200 km/h speed standard to allow new lines to be built to standards that can accommodate faster trains.},

	abstract = {Chinese mega-city regions have become a new scale of capital accumulation and state regulation. In recent years these regions have attracted much scholarly attention; however, the growing research on regional spaces in China is marked by a lack of what we term "realpolitik" and an absence of rigorous case studies. This study uses the "politics of scale" to empirically investigate the realpolitik factors in the intercity railway planning process in the Pearl River Delta. To this end, we establish a two-dimensional approach to unravel the interscalar and intercity politics during this process. We argue that in an institutional vacuum, ad hoc measures have been frequently used to facilitate interscalar and intercity bargaining. This case study also establishes a new perspective for understanding China's urban and regional transformation. Rather than treating the state as a passive agent, coping with the powerful forces of decentralization and market reform, we argue that the state has strategically redefined itself and has become even more sophisticated in its structures, functions, and tactics. The traditional one-sided and unidirectional approach to state-space analysis cannot adequately address these issues. A new perspective that considers the politics of various scales is needed to study the emerging state regime in China.},

	abstract = {The high-speed railway (HSR) has been an essential medium for intercity connections in China. However, despite the great achievements in HSR development, conventional railway (CR) still plays an important role in China’s railway passenger market. In this study, we construct urban networks based on China’s high-speed train (HST) and conventional train (CT) services, and compare the characteristics of HST and CT services in spatial distri­ bution. Moreover, policy implications are proposed for coordinating the HSR and CR systems based on the actual operating performance of the two modes. The results show that China’s HST and CT services are complementary in terms of spatial distribution. Both HSR and CR achieve high passenger volumes in prosperous regions, but CR performs better in areas with lower socioeconomic performance. We suggest that there is a significant potential for the cooperation between China’s HSR and CR systems, but some operating and technological challenges must be overcome.},

Employing the city-level turnover data of political leaders in China between 2000 and 2018 and utilizing the fixed effects ordered logit model, we find that the likelihood of promotion of local leaders rises with their economic performance. This relationship holds more firmly in the municipal party secretary. The probability is also found to decrease with the economic performance of their immediate predecessors and neighboring cities. This finding is robust to various robustness tests. We interpret the finding as evidence that the relative economic performance (peer effects) also contributes to the local political turnover, in particular within a province. Moreover, after the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, a material change in the personnel arrangement within the party arises and this promotion mechanism shows a dynamic change. Our study sheds some light on the growing literature emphasizing the relationship between political turnover and economic performance.},

This mismatch between politicians’ short tenures and the long-term needed for infrastructure projects to come to fruition is generally expected to result in underinvestment in critical infrastructure. However, recent data show that China makes massive investments in large-scale, long-term transportation projects. By proposing a political exchange model, we demonstrate a fundamental synergy between the incentives of short-term mayors and of provincial leaders that is realized as a result of subway projects. With both a difference-in-differences design and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we show that subway projects significantly increase the promotion chances of city mayors. Additional tests also confirm the mechanism of our theory. Mayors who obtain subway projects deliver economic benefits to provincial leaders. The provincial politicians’ prospects of promotion are significantly improved thanks to these economic returns.},

Previous studies have been unable to show the change characteristics between enterprises and the labor force at the county level. Therefore, based on the new economic geography theory, we first constructed a theoretical analysis framework to explore high-speed railway’s impact on county economy development and then obtained the two economic subdivision factors’ impacts: industrial enterprises and secondary labor force. Then, based on the panel data of 1791 county units in China from 2003 to 2019, the study constructed a multi-period PSM-DID model to empirically explore high-speed rail’s impact on the county’s agglomeration of industrial enterprises and secondary labor force. The results show that high-speed rail has a long-term negative effect on the county area’s agglomeration of industrial enterprises. From the perspective of the labor force, high-speed rail has a long-term and continuous positive effect on the agglomeration of the secondary labor force in county units.},

	abstract = {China’s high-speed railway network is one of the largest infrastructure programs in human history. Despite global media coverage, we know very little about the political process that led the government to invest in the railway program and the reasons for the striking regional and temporal variation in such investments. In Localized Bargaining, Xiao Ma offers a novel theory of intergovernmental bargaining that explains the unfolding of China's unprecedented high-speed railway program. Drawing on a wealth of in-depth interviews, original data sets, and surveys with local officials, Ma details how the bottom-up bargaining efforts by territorial authorities—whom the central bureaucracies rely on to implement various infrastructure projects—shaped the allocation of investment in the railway system. Territorial authorities and their leaders engage in localized bargaining to navigate and forge consensus among the fragmented entities that comprise the central bureaucracy; those who do so effectively gain an advantage for their localities. The book demonstrates in detail how localities of different types invoke institutional and extra-institutional sources of bargaining power in their competition for railway stations. These dynamics have broader implications for our understanding of the institutional arrangements that shape modern-day China and explain such phenomena as its economic miracle and the resilience of the communist government.},
